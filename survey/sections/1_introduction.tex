\section{Introduction}

This survey wants to explore the state of the art of the learning agents, focusing on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a way to learn the game of Pong.

The learning agents that will be treated are the reward-based.
The reward-based learning literature may be approximately divided into 
two subsets: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Stochastic Search methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) \cite{panait2005cooperative}.

Reinforcement Learning methods can be particularly useful in domains where penalties or rewards are provided after a sequence of actions performed in the environment \cite{panait2005cooperative}.

Evolutionary Computation is a family of techniques that uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution (Evolutionary Algorithms) to refine populations of candidate solutions to a given problem \cite{vikhar2016evolutionary}.

The state of the art of the learning agents such as Reinforcement Learning applied to pong, Markov Decision Making, Q-Learning, Deep Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Computation will be quickly covered precisely because of the importance that learning agents has been covering in recent years.
