\section{Introduction}
This survey wants to explore the state of the art of the learning agents, focusing on the reinforcement learning as a way to learn the game of Pong.
%
The learning agents that will be treated are the reward-based.
The reward-based learning literature includes reinforcement learning and stochastic search methods such as evolutionary algorithms \cite{panait2005cooperative}.

Reinforcement learning methods can be particularly useful in domains where penalties or rewards are provided after a sequence of actions performed in the environment \cite{panait2005cooperative}.
%
Evolutionary computation is a family of techniques that uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution (evolutionary algorithms) to refine populations of candidate solutions to a given problem \cite{vikhar2016evolutionary}.

The survey is organized as follows. \Cref{sec:learning-agents} gives an introduction of learning agents.
Next different methods to make the agents learn are presented: 
Markov Decision Process (\cref{sec:mdp}), reinforcement learning (\cref{sec:rl}), deep reinforcement learning (\cref{sec:drl}) and evolutionary computation (\cref{sec:evolutionary-computation}).
\Cref{sec:pong} cover the state of the art of learning agents specific for Pong. 
Conclusions are given in \cref{sec:conclusion}.
