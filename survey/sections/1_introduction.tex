\section{Introduction}

This survey deals with the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to make an agent learn Pong.

It is believed that Reinforcement Learning can provide a path towards generally capable agents \cite{silver2021reward}\cite{parker2022automated}.
Reinforcement Learning is very useful in today's world indeed it's widely used with self-driving cars, NLP, recommendation systems, financial trades, etc.

The state of the art of Reinforcement Learning applied to games such as pong and topics such as Markov Decision Making, Q-Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning will be quickly covered precisely because of the importance that RL has been covering in recent years.
